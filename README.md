# MoviesApi

This is small Web Api which was requested for a technical assesment. I have used .NET Core 3.0 and Entity Framework Core as the Data ORM using an In Memory Storage as the database. It has some seed data.

It has a swagger configuration to be able to easily view the api contract and test it. Once solution is built, you can run it locally and browse to:
{localhost and port}/swagger/index.html

I have not had the time to add unit tests, I will get to it later when I have some more free time.
